Genetic Algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem
===
A powerful genetic algorithm(GA) is used for solving the traveling salesman problem(TSP).

I use edge assembly crossover(EAX) and make some enhancements to it: 
(1)localization of EAX together with its efficient implementation and 

(2)the use of a local search procedure in EAX to determine good combinations of building blocks of parent solutions for
generating offspring solutions.

Experimental results on well-studied TSP benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed
 GA approaches state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms in finding very high-quality solutions on
instances with up to 10,000 cities.
